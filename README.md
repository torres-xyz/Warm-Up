# A Warm Up for an upcoming Unity coding assignment

I wanted to see how far I could flesh out a prototype in just 2 days.

The code is not particularly clean nor does it follow some best practices that I am accustomed to, but I made these concessions in exchange for speed and I believe they paid off.

The project has minimal visual flair, and the gameplay is not polished or balanced, but one can quickly test out the idea and decide if it would be worth developing it further or move on to the next prototype.
